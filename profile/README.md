## Hi there 👋

I'm [Sebastian Theo](https://github.com/sebtheo) and I'm creating **Survey Kit** in collaboration with [ONS](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation) for my final year dissertation at university.

Eventually, this organisation will be the home of multiple packages that allow developers to easily design and deploy bite-sized, engagement-driven surveys in the cloud.

The project aims to be:

- Open-source
- Mobile first
- Bite-sized
- Engaging
- Privacy focused

All to boost the dramatic drop in survey response rates.
